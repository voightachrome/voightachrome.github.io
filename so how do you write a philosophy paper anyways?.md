# How to write an Analytic Essay

## Analytic Essay

### Essays written for philosophy courses must be analytic or argumentative. An analytic essay is one in which you restate in your own words the argument—the line of reasoning from premises to conclusion—of an important passage of philosophy. In so doing, you show that you understand the structure of the argument.


### Read through the assigned passage of philosophy whose argument you are to explicate at least once before you begin writing. (It not only helps but often is necessary for you to have read the material preceding the passage.) Then try to isolate the principal claims(s) or conclusion(s), and the line of reasoning used by the author to support the claim(s) or conclusion(s). In doing this you may have to use your judgement as to what is central and what is tangential or peripheral to the philosopher’s position. You are interested in the former. To show that you understand what is going on, it always helps if you can illustrate the main points, especially the main distinctions, with clear examples of your own, that is, ones other than those used by the author.

### In writing up your results, avoid close paraphrase of the text: there is a difference between an analytic description and a close paraphrase of a passage of expository prose. Furthermore, though quotations can be helpful, do not quote unless you make clear that you understand what you are quoting.(For this paper DO NOT DIRECT QUOTE) Students often quote from hard passages because they do not understand them and this detracts from the paper. It is far better to try to work out a plausible interpretation of what is going on and to present it in your own words, than to feign understanding by the device of quotation. Finally, be as clear as you can. A helpful guideline is to write as if you were explaining the passage to an intelligent and interested person who has not read the text.


## Samuel's advice:
1. Write as clear and concisely as possible
2. Watch your word count, dont go on tangents, try to keep your word count as low as possible while maintaining a strong explication of the argument
3. Explain to other people and teach them to see if you understand the argument.
4. WRITE IN SIMPLE PROSE! use easy to understand language
5. In General, SIMPLE SIMPLE SIMPLE gets you over the bar to an A. The intro should be kept short, the thesis statement should be short (One sentance), Your body should be as short as it needs to be to properly explicate the argument, and the conclusion should be a shorter modified version of your intro.

## I will provide you a sample analytic paper so you can get an idea of what to do... GOOD LUCK!
