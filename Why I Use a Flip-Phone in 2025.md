## Why a Dumb Phone?
In the Summer of 2025, I decided to buy a flip phone. I was first introduced to the concept of a "dumb" phone in 2023 through a video by [James Scholz.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8qXtm_WKI&). He talked about how he used dumb phones to prioritize his time and attention, so he could spend more time on the things that were important to him. 

This really resonated with me. At the time of watching this, I was in my senior year of high school. I wasn't particularly good at school; that's not to say I was bad, but for my goals (at the time, I wanted to do Civil Engineering), they were certainly lacking. At the same time I was struggling in school, I was also really addicted to my smartphone, and my screentime would constantly reach anywhere from 8 to 10 hours a day. I wanted to fix my smartphone to see if it would help me get better at school. So, I decided to experiment with "dumbifying" my iPhone.
