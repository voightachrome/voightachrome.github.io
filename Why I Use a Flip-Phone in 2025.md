## Why a Dumb Phone?
In the Summer of 2025, I decided to buy a flip phone. I was first introduced to the concept of a "dumb" phone in 2023 through a video by [James Scholz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8qXtm_WKI&). He talked about how he used dumb phones to prioritize his time and attention, so he could spend more time on the things that were important to him.

This really resonated with me. At the time of watching this, I was in my senior year of high school. I wasn't particularly good at school; that's not to say I was bad, but for my goals (at the time, I wanted to do Civil Engineering), they were certainly lacking. At the same time I was struggling in school, I was also really addicted to my smartphone, and my screentime would constantly reach anywhere from 8 to 10 hours a day. I wanted to fix my smartphone addiction to see if it would help me get better at school. So, I decided to experiment with "dumbifying" my iPhone. While this worked to help me lower my screentime. I found myself slowly turning off these blockers and apps, and eventually, I ended up back where I started, and after my lack of success with “dumbifying” my iPhone, I decided to abandon the idea.

Fastforward to my first year of university, and while my grades were pretty acceptable now, I continued to find myself increasingly addicted to my phone. It wasn't good for my relationships, and the feeling of commuting for hours, only to not remember any of it because I was on my phone the entire time, was mind-numbing to say the least. Eventually, I just got fatigued from my phone entirely and became determined to set a boundary between myself and it. All of this culminated in August of 2025, when I decided to make a change for good, and I bought a flip phone. 

## The Phone
The phone I bought is a Kyocera 902kc. It’s a flip phone with a camera, (which is surprisingly not bad. It has a pretty nostalgic look.)

The Kyocera 902kc can hotspot, text and call, and it runs Android 8.1, which lets me download the basic apps I need. (Spotify/Apple Music, university recreation app, Maps, etc.) But because it's still a flip phone, it doesn’t have the power to run social media apps like Instagram or TikTok. Nor would I want to run apps like that on a flip-phone. Typing on it is slow; it crashes if more than two apps are open at the same time; there are no live directions in maps; and pretty much every part of using it is unpleasant. I find myself not wanting to use it at all (at most, I use it for 30 minutes a day, excluding music).

It’s for that very reason that I love this phone; it does everything I need it to, and none of what I don't, and it allows me to spend my time and save my attention on the people and things that matter the most. 

If you are interested in the 902kc, please do research as to whether your service provider supports this phone. You can do this by checking [the supported bands for the 902kc](https://www.softbank.jp/biz/set/data/mobile/lineup/keitai/digno_keitai3_for_biz/specs/pdf/digno_keitai3_for_biz.pdf) to see if your provider supports them, as well as checking whether your provider has a whitelist for only certain devices, which can potentially affect your service (this is the case with AT&T in America, and it might be the case with your provider as well). Also important to note is that, while the 902kc is a 4G phone, some service providers in Canada plan to shut down 3G service, which could hurt service on the phone as a fallback when 4G is unavailable. As of now, I can confirm that in Canada, it works with Telus/Koodo and Rogers/Fido in metropolitan areas.

I was able to purchase it through a local listing on Reddit for 100 CAD, but I have seen them on Facebook Marketplace around 150 CAD in the Greater Toronto Area. If you are unable to find this model locally, then you can either purchase one on eBay, or import one from Japan using a service like Buyee.

Some good resources on dumbphones can be found on [r/dumbphones](https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/) (for general knowledge on all dumbphones) and [r/garaho](https://www.reddit.com/r/garaho/) (for knowledge on Japanese/Korean flip phones like the 902kc) on Reddit. If you have questions, please leave them in the comments. I will try my best to answer!

I would now like to shift my attention to respond to potential questions or worries about using a dumbphone, as well as some criticisms i have heard.

## Just Develop Self-Control!
To me, the people who raise this criticism do not understand the lengths to which tech companies have gone to keep us on our phones for as long as possible. For them, the goal of a smartphone is to keep you on it as much as possible, so you spend more time on certain apps (like Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, etc.) and, in turn, see more ads. That’s how they make money, and because of this, tech companies have put billions into making smartphones more addictive, and it’s working. So, it doesn’t seem that telling someone who’s addicted to their phone just to develop self-control is an appropriate answer. It’s akin to telling someone who’s going through cigarette/vape addiction to just develop self-control; it does not work that way. (Not to say that smartphone addiction is worse than those addictions. It’s just to say that the response does not work, because they’re both designed to be addictive.) Therefore, like people who are addicted to various other things, we too should be working to separate ourselves and create healthier relationships with our phones and technology as a whole. 

## I Can’t Live Without (Insert) App!
It seems that the recent rise of new technologies have tricked us into thinking that they are necessary for our existence, as if most of us were not able to live before these apps became available (this is by design; I will write about this another time). This is a lie; we can live without 24/7 access to Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, or TikTok. If you want to continue using those apps, use them on a computer where they are less of a distraction. If you have friends who make it impossible for you to go without 24/7 social media access, maybe you should re-evaluate those friendships. It is not hard to call or text someone when you need them. If you have family who uses WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, or you need a phone that supports 2FA or banking apps, there are numerous dumbphones that can run them, as long as they have Android (as well as Google Play Services for banking apps). [Defer to Jose Briones’s dumbphone finder tool](https://www.dumbphones.org/) or [r/dumbphones](https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/) if you need help finding a phone that supports these apps. If you need a notes app, carry a notebook and a pen. If you need a calendar app, use the new found notebook and pen to write the event, then add it to your calendar app while on your computer. Everything has a workaround, and most of the things we consider necessary are things we can live without for a couple of hours a day. We have done it before; we can do it again.
