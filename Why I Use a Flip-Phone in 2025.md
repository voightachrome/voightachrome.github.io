## Why a Dumb Phone?
In the Summer of 2025, I decided to buy a flip phone. I was first introduced to the concept of a "dumb" phone in 2023 through a video by [James Scholz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8qXtm_WKI&). He talked about how he used dumb phones to prioritize his time and attention, so he could spend more time on the things that were important to him.

This really resonated with me. At the time of watching this, I was in my senior year of high school. I wasn't particularly good at school; that's not to say I was bad, but for my goals (at the time, I wanted to do Civil Engineering), they were certainly lacking. At the same time I was struggling in school, I was also really addicted to my smartphone, and my screentime would constantly reach anywhere from 8 to 10 hours a day. I wanted to fix my smartphone to see if it would help me get better at school. So, I decided to experiment with "dumbifying" my iPhone. While this worked for me for a time and helped me lower my screentime. I found myself slowly turning off these blockers and of high school apps, and eventually, I ended up back where I started, and after my lack of success with “dumbifying” my iPhone, I forgot about the idea.

Fastforward to my first year of university, while my grades were pretty acceptable now, I continued to find myself increasingly addicted to my phone. It wasn't good for my relationships, and the feeling of commuting for hours, only to not remember any of it because I was on my phone the entire time, was mind-numbing to say the least. Eventually, I just got tired of my phone entirely and became determined to set a boundary between myself and it. All of this culminated in August of 2025, when I decided to make a change for good, and I bought a flip phone. 


## The Phone
The phone I bought is a Kyocera 902kc. It’s a flip phone with a camera, (which is surprisingly not bad. It has a pretty nostalgic look.)

The Kyocera 902kc can hotspot, text and call, and it runs Android 8.1, which lets me download the basic apps I need. (Spotify/Apple Music, university recreation app, Maps, etc.) But because it is still a flip phone, it doesn’t have the power to run social media apps like Instagram or TikTok. Nor would I want to run apps like that on a flip-phone. Typing on it is slow; it crashes if more than two apps are open at the same time; there are no live directions in maps; and pretty much every part of using it is unpleasant. I find myself not wanting to use it at all (at most, I use it for 30 minutes a day, excluding music). 

It’s for that very reason that I love this phone; it does everything I need it to, and none of what I do not, and it allows me to spend my time and save my attention on the people and things that matter the most. 

If you are interested in the 902kc, please do research as to whether your service provider supports this phone. You can do this by checking [the supported bands for 902kc](https://www.softbank.jp/biz/set/data/mobile/lineup/keitai/digno_keitai3_for_biz/specs/pdf/digno_keitai3_for_biz.pdf) to see if your provider supports them, as well as checking whether your provider has a whitelist for only certain devices, which can potentially affect your service (this is the case with AT&T in america, and it might be the case with your provider as well). Also important to note is that, while the 902kc is a 4G phone, some service providers in Canada plan to shut down 3G service, which could hurt service on the phone as a fallback when 4G is unavailable. As of now, I can confirm that in Canada, it works with Telus/Koodo and Rogers/Fido in metropolitan areas.

I was able to purchase it through a local listing on Reddit for 100 CAD, but I have seen them on Facebook Marketplace around 150 CAD in the Greater Toronto Area. If you are unable to find this model locally, then you can either purchase one on eBay, or import one from Japan using a service like Buyee.

Some good resources on dumbphones can be found on [r/dumbphones](https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/) (for general knowledge on all dumbphones) and [r/garaho](https://www.reddit.com/r/garaho/) (for knowledge on Japanese/Korean flip phones like the 902kc) on Reddit. If you have questions, please leave them in the comments. I will try my best to answer!

I would now like to shift my attention to respond to potential questions or worries about using a dumbphone, as well as some criticisms i have heard.
