## Why a Dumb Phone?
In the Summer of 2025, I decided to buy a flip phone. I was first introduced to the concept of a "dumb" phone in 2023 through a video by [James Scholz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8qXtm_WKI&). He talked about how he used dumb phones to prioritize his time and attention, so he could spend more time on the things that were important to him.

`My "Dumb" iPhone Setup`

This really resonated with me. At the time of watching this, I was in my senior year of high school. I wasn't particularly good at school; that's not to say I was bad, but for my goals (at the time, I wanted to do Civil Engineering), they were certainly lacking. At the same time I was struggling in school, I was also really addicted to my smartphone, and my screentime would constantly reach anywhere from 8 to 10 hours a day. I wanted to fix my smartphone to see if it would help me get better at school. So, I decided to experiment with "dumbifying" my iPhone.

While this worked for me for a time and helped me lower my screentime. I found myself slowly turning off these blockers and of high school apps, and eventually, I ended up back where I started.
