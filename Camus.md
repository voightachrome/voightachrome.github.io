For Camus, it seems that the most important philosophical question is the question of why people commit suicide. Every other question is a sort of game, people dont choose to end their own lines on if the mind is purely physical, or if it is both physical or immaterial. But people obviously choose to commit suicide because they view live as not worth living. Once we understand why, then we can worry about the rest of our lives. 

So why do people end their lives, there doesnt seem to be any express event that we can pinpoint for why a person would choose to end their lives. To show this, I would like to use a differing example. **Love**
