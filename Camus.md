# Camus, The Absurd, Revolt (and a short tangent on love)

For Camus, it seems that the most important philosophical question is the question of why people commit suicide. Every other question is a sort of game, people dont choose to end their own lines on if the mind is purely physical, or if it is both physical or immaterial. But people obviously choose to commit suicide because they view live as not worth living. Once we understand why, then we can worry about the rest of our lives. 

So why do people end their lives? For Camus, there doesnt seem to be any express event that we can pinpoint for why a person would choose to end their lives. To show this, I would like to use a differing example. **Love**

If i were to ask why you fall in love with someone. You could probably give out a list of reasons for why. Maybe they need to be funny or smart, or attractive, or they need to remember little details about your life, they need to be fun to be aroud, they need to be respectful or responsible, or someone you can imagine starting a family with, etc. But when you really think about it, there are many other people who fit these supposed boxes of what we want out of a partner. I myself have met people who have checked all of these supposed boxes of love, yet I can't bring myself to love them. We often find ourselves in love with people who do not meet all of our boxes, and people who are not good for us. So there is a sense that love transends any individual reasons. The invidual reasons dont fully explain love.  

In the same way, I do not think we can find invididual reasons that can fully explain why we commit suicide. Maybe they went through financial problems, maybe they went through abuse or assult throughout their lives, maybe a loved one died and they could never get over their loss. But we cant look at these reasons as full explanations of why people end their lives. Mainly because other people have went through the same things, and have continued to live onwards. In fact, most people go through shitty experiences in their life, and continue to persevere. 

So maybe to understand why others consider life to not be worth living. We should consider why most people consider live to be worth living. As maybe it will fill us in on what people who commit suicide see versus the rest of us.
