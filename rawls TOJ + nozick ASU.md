# **Understanding Rawls Theory of Justice + Some Nozick (Notes for PHIL 2923)**


## Justice vs Legitimacy
Rawls is trying to answer a fundamental question: what makes an ideally just society? In this way, he differs from past social contract theorists who were concerned with legitimacy. A legitimate state is a state that performs the minimal functions required to be considered a state; a state like Haiti, for example, might be considered illegitimate because it is not meeting the necessary bar of what a state is supposed to be doing. However, with Rawls, he is concerned with what an ideal state looks like, which is more complex than what a legitimate state looks like. For example, China is a legitimate state, but it is by no means a just one. So we are trying to answer the questions: do we want our state to look more like Russia, Sweden, China, or Canada? And how can we improve to reach the ideal state? 

## The Problem?
Rawls starts, as Hobbes and Marx did, with a couple of minimal assumptions about the world. However, unlike those two, these assumptions are uncontroversial enough that I cannot help but agree. 

- Premise 1: Humans have to live together in this world
- Premise 2: To continually survive, it is in our best interest to cooperate, make rules, and whatnot, and make them as good as possible. 
- Premise 3: We all have different conceptions of what makes a good life and what makes a just society. (A catholic has a different idea of a just society and good life than a Buddhist, and a rich person has a different conception than a poor person, etc.) 
**Conclusion:** We cannot make the best possible rules because we cannot agree on what is just and unjust. 

So this is the problem Rawls is dealing with: how can we create a society that is just for everyone when everyone disagrees on what makes a just society? This is the idea of Justice as fairness between everyone in society.

## The Original Position
The way that Rawls gets out of this issue is as follows, and all of it is called The Original Position. He sets up an imaginary thought experiment. Imagine that you do not have any information regarding particular facts about yourself. A particular fact relates to your identity or life experience. So in this thought experiment, you **do not** know about your race, your gender, socioeconomic status, religion, whether you are hard working or lazy, your motivations for living, what you value as good in life, or your talents. You do not know anything about yourself. What you do know under this thought experiment are general facts about the world. So you know that race, gender, and socioeconomic status exist, and how they affect people. You know that people can be lazy or hardworking, and you know how that affects them. You just do not know how it relates to you specifically. The second thing about this thought experiment is that we are assuming that the people in the experiment are acting rationally (this is sort of a given though). Rawls calls this the Veil of Ignorance.

Under this veil, it would radically change how we make decisions. First, people would no longer have any bias in the decisions they make in respect to facts about themselves. For example, lets imagine that Soap is a doctor, and she wants to advocate for the rule that all Asian American Women who happen to be Doctors in the United States need to make more money than Jeff Bezos. Soap would only advocate for that because she also happens to be an Asian American Woman who also happens to be a Doctor. There is obvious bias here. However, if you imagine soap were to put on the veil of ignorance, she would no longer advocate for such a rule, because she does not know that she is Asian American, a Woman, or a Doctor. So the veil of ignorance knocks out a lot of bias. 


## Clarifying Remarks
### Institutional Justice vs Individual Justice
Rawls is primarily concerned with Institutional Justice rather than Individual Justice. So when we use the veil of ignorance, we aim to create laws that can be applied to the institutions of our society. The reason for this is as follows: Lets say that soap is trying to get a job as a Doctor, and as she goes to the interview and meets with the hiring manager, the hiring manager sees that she is asian and a woman and says "oh sorry soap but we don't hire asian women, we only hire 6'0+ wasian men named Peter. This is obviously discrimination, and if this is a case of individual injustice, Soap can go and report the hiring manager for discrimination, or take them to court, or find a different position at one of the many other hospitals that do not discriminate against people based on race. 

However, if this was a case of Institutional Injustice, and actually, it is in the law that soap cannot get hired as a doctor because she is Asian and a woman. She has no way to fight against the hiring manager or get a job elsewhere as a Doctor. Her life prospects have fundamentally changed. So in this way, Rawls is trying to tackle a bigger and more fundamental question than one of individual injustice

### Objections to the Original Position 
There are 2 big objections that have been raised against the veil of ignorance as a concept. 

The first one is a question of how we are supposed to place ourselves in the veil of ignorance and make choices. 

Rawls would respond by saying that this is a misunderstanding as to how should use the veil of ignorance. For Rawls, we should use it as a tool to compare the principles we come up with. Lets go back to the first example with Soap. Soap is advocating for all Asian American Women who are Doctors in the United States to make more money than Jeff Bezos. If Soap took that idea and asked herself the question "would i do that under the veil of ignorance? would i advocate for this if i did not know i was a woman or asian or was a doctor?" If the answer for her is no, than it is probably not a good principle to advocate for.

The second objection is harder to understand, if you have a question let me know. It goes like this. Hypotheticals do not contain binding agreements. The veil of ignorance is a hypothetical situation. Therefore, the principles we come up using it are not binding principles. Imagine Vik was buying Daniel's ereader. Vik asks Daniel if he would sell it for 100 bucks, and Daniel responds "I could, but im really fixed at 150 right now, and i would rather sell it for 150, i dont feel 100 at the moment." This obviously does not give vik the right to give Daniel 100 dollars and take the ereader out of his hands and walk away. He never formally agreed to sell it for 100 dollars. 

I think the second objection falls under the same issue as the first one. It is not like the veil of ignorance makes the principles or whether we agree to them for us. We use it as a tool to create more just principles and then ask ourselves "Should we agree to this rule/principle". So i think Rawls avoids both objections.
