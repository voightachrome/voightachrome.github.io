## Understanding Rawls Theory of Justice + Some Nozick (Notes for PHIL 2923)


### Justice vs Legitimacy
Rawls is trying to answer a fundamental question: what makes an ideally just society? In this way, he differs from past social contract theorists who were concerned with legitimacy. A legitimate state is a state that performs the minimal functions required to be considered a state; a state like Haiti, for example, might be considered illegitimate because it is not meeting the necessary bar of what a state is supposed to be doing. However, with Rawls, he is concerned with what an ideal state looks like, which is more complex than what a legitimate state looks like. For example, China is a legitimate state, but it is by no means a just one. So we are trying to answer the questions: do we want our state to look more like Russia, Sweden, China, or Canada? And how can we improve to reach the ideal state? 

### The main problem 
Rawls starts, as Hobbes and Marx did, with a couple of minimal assumptions about the world. However, unlike those two, these assumptions are uncontroversial enough that I cannot help but agree. 

- Premise 1: Humans have to live together in this world
- Premise 2: To continually survive, it is in our best interest to cooperate, make rules, and whatnot, and make them as good as possible. 
- Premise 3: We all have different conceptions of what makes a good life and what makes a just society. (A catholic has a different idea of a just society and good life than a Buddhist, and a rich person has a different conception than a poor person, etc.) 
**Conclusion:** We cannot make the best possible rules because we cannot agree on what is just and unjust. 

So this is the problem Rawls is dealing with: how can we create a society that is just for everyone when everyone disagrees on what makes a just society? This is the idea of Justice as fairness between everyone in society.

### The Original Position
The way that Rawls gets out of this issue is as follows, and all of it is called The Original Position. He sets up an imaginary thought experiment. Imagine that you do not have any information regarding particular facts about yourself. A particular fact relates to your identity or life experience. So in this thought experiment, you **do not** know about your race, your gender, socioeconomic status, religion, whether you are hard working or lazy, your motivations for living, what you value as good in life, or your talents. You do not know anything about yourself. What you do know under this thought experiment are general facts about the world. So you know that race, gender, and socioeconomic status exist, and how they affect people. You know that people can be lazy or hardworking, and you know how that affects them. You just do not know how it relates to you specifically. The second thing about this thought experiment is that we are assuming that the people in the experiment are acting rationally (this is sort of a given though). Rawls calls this the Veil of Ignorance.

Under this veil, it would radically change how we make decisions. First, people would no longer have any bias in the decisions they make in respect to facts about themselves. For example, lets imagine that Soap is a doctor, and she wants to advocate for the rule that all Asian American Women who happen to be Doctors in the United States need to make more money than Jeff Bezos. Soap would only advocate for that because she also happens to be an Asian American Woman who also happens to be a Doctor. There is obvious bias here. However, if you imagine soap were to put on the veil of ignorance, she would no longer advocate for such a rule, because she does not know that she is Asian American, a Woman, or a Doctor. So the veil of ignorance knocks out a lot of bias.
