# **Understanding Rawls Theory of Justice + Some Nozick (Notes for PHIL 2923)**


## Justice vs Legitimacy
Rawls is trying to answer a fundamental question: what makes an ideally just society? In this way, he differs from past social contract theorists who were concerned with legitimacy. A legitimate state is a state that performs the minimal functions required to be considered a state; a state like Haiti, for example, might be considered illegitimate because it is not meeting the necessary bar of what a state is supposed to be doing. However, with Rawls, he is concerned with what an ideal state looks like, which is more complex than what a legitimate state looks like. For example, China is a legitimate state, but it is by no means a just one. So we are trying to answer the questions: do we want our state to look more like Russia, Sweden, China, or Canada? And how can we improve to reach the ideal state? 

## The Problem?
Rawls starts, as Hobbes and Marx did, with a couple of minimal assumptions about the world. However, unlike those two, these assumptions are uncontroversial enough that I cannot help but agree. 

- Premise 1: Humans have to live together in this world
- Premise 2: To continually survive, it is in our best interest to cooperate, make rules, and whatnot, and make them as good as possible. 
- Premise 3: We all have different conceptions of what makes a good life and what makes a just society. (A catholic has a different idea of a just society and good life than a Buddhist, and a rich person has a different conception than a poor person, etc.) 
**Conclusion:** We cannot make the best possible rules because we cannot agree on what is just and unjust. 

So this is the problem Rawls is dealing with: how can we create a society that is just for everyone when everyone disagrees on what makes a just society? This is the idea of Justice as fairness between everyone in society.

## The Original Position
The way that Rawls gets out of this issue is as follows, and all of it is called The Original Position. He sets up an imaginary thought experiment. Imagine that you do not have any information regarding particular facts about yourself. A particular fact relates to your identity or life experience. So in this thought experiment, you **do not** know about your race, your gender, socioeconomic status, religion, whether you are hard working or lazy, your motivations for living, what you value as good in life, or your talents. You do not know anything about yourself. What you do know under this thought experiment are general facts about the world. So you know that race, gender, and socioeconomic status exist, and how they affect people. You know that people can be lazy or hardworking, and you know how that affects them. You just do not know how it relates to you specifically. The second thing about this thought experiment is that we are assuming that the people in the experiment are acting rationally (this is sort of a given though). Rawls calls this the Veil of Ignorance.

Under this veil, it would radically change how we make decisions. First, people would no longer have any bias in the decisions they make in respect to facts about themselves. For example, lets imagine that Soap is a doctor, and she wants to advocate for the rule that all Asian American Women who happen to be Doctors in the United States need to make more money than Jeff Bezos. Soap would only advocate for that because she also happens to be an Asian American Woman who also happens to be a Doctor. There is obvious bias here. However, if you imagine soap were to put on the veil of ignorance, she would no longer advocate for such a rule, because she does not know that she is Asian American, a Woman, or a Doctor. So the veil of ignorance knocks out a lot of bias. 


## Clarifying Remarks

### Institutional Justice vs Individual Justice
Rawls is primarily concerned with Institutional Justice rather than Individual Justice. So when we use the veil of ignorance, we aim to create laws that can be applied to the institutions of our society. The reason for this is as follows: Lets say that soap is trying to get a job as a Doctor, and as she goes to the interview and meets with the hiring manager, the hiring manager sees that she is asian and a woman and says "oh sorry soap but we don't hire asian women, we only hire 6'0+ wasian men named Peter. This is obviously discrimination, and if this is a case of individual injustice, Soap can go and report the hiring manager for discrimination, or take them to court, or find a different position at one of the many other hospitals that do not discriminate against people based on race. 

However, if this was a case of Institutional Injustice, and actually, it is in the law that soap cannot get hired as a doctor because she is Asian and a woman. She has no way to fight against the hiring manager or get a job elsewhere as a Doctor. Her life prospects have fundamentally changed. So in this way, Rawls is trying to tackle a bigger and more fundamental question than one of individual injustice

### Objections to the Original Position 
There are 2 big objections that have been raised against the veil of ignorance as a concept. 

The first one is a question of how we are supposed to place ourselves in the veil of ignorance and make choices. 

Rawls would respond by saying that this is a misunderstanding as to how should use the veil of ignorance. For Rawls, we should use it as a tool to compare the principles we come up with. Lets go back to the first example with Soap. Soap is advocating for all Asian American Women who are Doctors in the United States to make more money than Jeff Bezos. If Soap took that idea and asked herself the question "would i do that under the veil of ignorance? would i advocate for this if i did not know i was a woman or asian or was a doctor?" If the answer for her is no, than it is probably not a good principle to advocate for.

The second objection is harder to understand, It goes like this:

- P1: Hypotheticals do not contain binding agreements. 
- P2: The veil of ignorance is a hypothetical situation.
- C: Therefore, the principles we come up using it are not binding principles. 

Imagine Vik was buying Daniel's ereader. Vik asks Daniel if he would sell it for 100 bucks, and Daniel responds "I could, but im really fixed at 150 right now, and i would rather sell it for 150, i dont feel 100 at the moment." This obviously does not give vik the right to give Daniel 100 dollars and take the ereader out of his hands and walk away. He never formally agreed to sell it for 100 dollars. 

I think the second objection falls under the same issue as the first one. It is not like the veil of ignorance makes the principles or whether we agree to them for us. We use it as a tool to create more just principles and then ask ourselves "Should we agree to this rule/principle". So i think Rawls avoids both objections.


### Self Interest vs Ideals of Justice (the general conception of the original position) 
If you are under the veil of ignorance, we make principles out of self interest and not out of an ideal of justice, and we do so to retain goods that would be good for us regardless of our conception of the good life. For Rawls, if we are under the veil of ignorance, self interest for one becomes justice for all. If you do not know your particular place in society, you are going to make rules which are just for everyone, to make sure that they end up being just for you.

## A question of method
There is a question about how we should go about applying the original position. Rawls says a bunch of stuff about this. He first thinks about three questions that we must answer.

- The question of liberty: How can we secure liberties so people are free to be able to fulfill their conception of a good life. 
- The question of opportunity: How can we secure opportunities to be able to fulfill our conception of a good life
- The question of distribution: How should we distribute resources for people to be able to fulfill our conception of the good life. 


For Rawls, The liberty principle takes priority over the other two. There is also the difference principle which argues that we should  consider the position of the worst off the most when we make decisions. if you do not understand thats fine i will explain all of it.

## Priority of the Liberty Principle

### Liberty vs Liberties
The liberty principle for Rawls is concerned with liberties and not liberty. Liberty is more concerned maximization of freedom, and that is not really what we are considering here. We are trying to find principles which allow us to pursue our ideal good life. So an example of one of these liberties would be the right to non-discrimination, or freedom of religion, freedom to own personal property, or freedom of speech.

### Lexical Ordering
There is a reason why the liberty principle takes priority over the other two. Remember our example of soap not being able to get a job as a doctor because of she was being institutionally discriminated against? We cant worry about questions about if there are enough opportunities, or questions on if we have enough resources to distribute equally, until we have answered the question of liberty. None of those things matter for soap because she is already locked out from being able to achieve her conception of the good life because of her lack of liberties.

Another way Rawls argues for this is through the idea that resources are only useful in so far as they help us secure our conception of the good life. But if we cannot pursue our conception of the good life because of a lack of liberties, it seems that our resources become useless to us. 

### Does the liberty principle always have priority? 
The liberty principle in general has priority over the other principles, but **(to me)** there is also a sense that in non-ideal situations the liberty principle can be overridden in order to justify something greater in that moment. For example, if you live in a society where people are starving because they cannot afford food, whatever good life they could possibly want to achieve is not gonna be possible in that moment through liberties, it would be possible through making sure they can survive on a day to day basis. So we can potentially justify suspending certain liberties in order to prioritize the other principles, but we have to have justification for suspending those liberties in that moment.

## The opportunity principle
The opportunity principle is the second principle Rawls adresses in his original position. I think it is pretty easy to see why the opportunity principle is necessary to fulfilling our conceptions of the good life. The argument for it is very similar to the argument for the liberty principle. Lets use Soap as an example again. Lets imagine that Soap is applying for med school in Canada because she wants to become a doctor. Getting into med school in the country of Canada is an exceedingly difficult thing because of the incredibly low med school admission rates, and an incredibly low amount of residency positions, and the people involved in this system seem have no want to advocate for increased admission + residency positions. Even though there is an overwhelming shortage for doctors of all kinds within Canada. This is not really fair at all. Soap should be able to have the opportunity to become a doctor in Canada and fulfil her dreams.


This is what Rawls advocates for: **Equality of opportunity.** He says that people who have the same talents/abilities for a field, and the same drive to attain them, should be able to have the same prospects when it comes to whatever they want to do. 

### Is this just a pipe dream? Is Rawls onto something?

There are a bunch of questions that come with the equality of opportunity principle, first of which is that it seems very difficult to do this in real life. If we are to carry out the equality of oppurtunity principle, then everyone regardless if they are poor or rich and regardless of their ethnicity or gender should be able to make it in their field as long as they have the same level of talent and the same ability to use them. 

Putting that aside, this seems like something we would agree too under the veil of ignorance. It also seems like a good thing to advocate for in general, one can imaging that there are a lot of untapped talent in marginalized communities which either can not be developed because a person is too poor or is discriminated against. This does not seem like something we should be okay with. 

### Why Equality of Opportunity is Not Sufficient
There is a big issue with the equality of opportunity principle as presented by Rawls. It has to do with the fact that a the people involved have to have an equal level of talent and ability and an equal level of drive to use those talents/abilities. You can choose to believe that everyone is talented and everyone has abilities, and you can make the argument for that. But what you cant make the argument for is that everyone has a marketable talent or ability. You can imagine someone like Soap who is really talented at STEM, and a person like Finnan who is really good at eating desserts during thanksgiving. Soap's talent is far more marketable than Finnan's. So, if we are under the veil of ignorance, it does not seem sufficient just to account for equality of opportunity when you do not know if you will have marketable talents or the drive to use them.

## The Difference Principle
The difference principle is probably the most progressive principle within the original position. It says that when we make principles of justice, it is in our best interest to prioritize the position of the worst off. 

So lets imagine a Society called Society A, and another one called Society B. Society A is an equal society where everyone is making equal  (yet very little) amount of money. and in Society B, there is a some inequality in terms of what people are making, but it is not radical. Most importantly the lowest off position Is better off in society B than they were in society A. So it seems that we should go through some inequality and choose Society B because the lowest position will be better off.

`Visual Representation of Society A and Society B`


Now lets take Society B and  compare it to Society C. In Society C inequality is vastly greater, people are making far more money at the top of the distribution than they were in society B. Would it make sense to choose to live in society C than Society B? You can even think about this like its a lottery. If you end up at the top of the distribution you get great gain, vastly more than you would make if you chose society B.

For Rawls however, It does not make sense to choose to live in Society C over Society B. When we are making a decision under the Veil of Ignorance, the risks that make sense when you are choosing the prospects for your life (when its the only life you have) are different from just betting on a lottery. You have to really understand and accept being put in any social condition under the veil of ignorance. I do not think most people would accept being the worst off person in Society C.
Im curious if people here would really choose Society C over Society B? Please comment and let me know!

## Nozick and Lockean Property Rights 
Nozick starts off by talking about property rights as the basis of liberty. There are three basic rules for Nozick in regard to property rights. lets use Soap as an example.  

1. If Soap acquires something through legitimate means, it is hers
2. If someone transfers something to Soap legitimately, It is hers
3. Soap cannot transfer or acquire something without repeated application of 1 or 2

There is also the principle of rectification, if Soap acquires something illegitimately, she has the responsibility to rectify that injustice. That can be done through a number of ways. 

One way that Nozick differs from Rawls is that he is not concerned with making rules that apply to the structures of society, he is only worried about individual acquisition and transfers, everything outside of that is fair game. What this means is that things like discrimination are okay for Nozick, as long as they do not involve illegitimate acquisition or illegitimate transfer. You can turn away someone from your cake shop for being gay or for being black as long as you havent broken these rules, and the state should not stop it unless it does break these rules.
