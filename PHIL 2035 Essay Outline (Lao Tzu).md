## The Prompt
Summarize and critically evaluate the Tao Te Ching’s views on values. Is Lao Tzu correct that our problems come from over-thinking? Is passivity always better than determined action?


## Intro
In "Tao Te Ching," Lao Tzu argues that we should act in accordance with the Tao (The Way) (Lao Tzu p.139). He argues that our virtues (Te) must follow the Tao (Lao Tzu p.150). Not acting in harmony with the Tao will lead to disorder and struggle (Lao Tzu p.166).
## Thesis
 In this paper, I argue that Lao Tzu is correct in saying that our problems come from overthinking. However, I further argue that passivity is not always better than determined action. I reconstruct and argue to this conclusion.

## Lao Tzu Argument Reconstruction
- ### P1:  The Tao is the governing force of the universe
	- Lao Tzu starts by going through what he refers to as the Tao (The Way). He describes the Tao as ineffable. He says, "The Tao that can be told of is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name" (Lao Tzu p.136). Any attempt to describe the Tao with language fails to encompass its full nature. Lao Tzu then describes the Tao as the governing force of the universe (Lao Tzu p.153). He says, "Man models himself after Earth. Earth models itself after Heaven. [And] Heaven models itself after Tao". The Tao also models itself after nature (Lao Tzu p.153). Like a big storm, the Tao is spontaneous; it imposes itself upon us, and we have no control over it. It is something that we have to accommodate and respect. Lastly, just like nature, the Tao is impartial to all who inhabit it. Lao Tzu says, "Heaven and Earth are not humane." (Lao Tzu p.142). The Tao makes no distinction between smart and dumb, beautiful and ugly, or good and bad (Lao Tzu p.). For Lao Tzu, these are artificial distinctions created by society, and because they are not natural, they are incompatible with the Tao. 
- ### P2: When the Tao is possessed by people, it becomes Te (Virtue) 
	- Lao Tzu then goes on to talk about Te. For Lao Tzu, when Tao harnesses things, it becomes Te. A defining characteristic of virtue for Lao Tzu is that even though the Tao makes no artificial distinctions, it likes things that society considers conventionally weak. 
- ### P3: Things which are conventionally true (Masculine ideals of virtue) are not ultimately true.
	- He uses symbols of Te to show this. The first symbol is that of the feminine; it is important to note that for Lao Tzu, masculinity is associated with the artificial, with strength, size, dominance, and wisdom. In comparison, femininity is associated with the natural, with weakness, humility, and softness. Lao Tzu argues that strong and big things are easily subject to nature. Masculine virtues are like a big tree: strong and dominant but at the same time rigid and inflexible. When put through the trials of nature (like a big storm), the tree will snap and break (Lao Tzu p.174). On the other hand, things that are tender and weak are flexible and adaptive. Feminine virtues are like a small sapling: Tender and weak but flexible enough to withstand a big storm (Lao Tzu p.174). Lao Tzu also uses water as an example of conventional weakness. Water is soft and yielding; it is the definition of being conventionally weak. However, when water takes the form of a tsunami, it crushes conventionally strong objects. He says, "All the world knows that the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard. But none can practice it." (Lao Tzu p.175).  So, for Lao Tzu, we should keep to the feminine (Lao Tzu p.154) and be more like water because whatever is considered as conventionally weak is ultimately strong.
- ### P4: Wu-Wei (Non Action)
	 -  Lastly, because the Tao follows what is natural, Lao Tzu says that we should do the same, and he describes this as wu-wei (non-action). He says, “[t]he pursuit of Tao is to decrease day after day. It is to decrease and further decrease until one reaches the point of taking no action. No action is undertaken, and yet nothing is left undone." (Lao Tzu p.162). Wu-wei does not mean that you do nothing; it means only doing things that come naturally and effortlessly (Lao Tzu p.172). What this idea of wu-wei illustrates is that assertive actions bring opposite effects. For example, constantly trying to micromanage in a group assignment will make your group mates more resistant to your actions. If you want to make muddy water clear, you cannot shake it with your hand; instead, by not interfering, it will become clear on its own (Lao Tzu p.147). So, for Lao Tzu, we can accomplish much more by following wu-wei and acting effortlessly.
## Argument Against Overthinking
 - ### (P1) Conventional ideas of knowledge should be abandoned; they are not ultimately true.
	- Since the Tao considers conventional truth to be artificial, and ultimate truth to be what is natural, we should abandon conventional ideas of knowledge (Lao Tzu p.149). Conventional ideas of knowledge consist of things like social norms, traditions, and hierarchy, but these are all artificial distinctions created by society; they are not ultimately true. When you chase after conventional ideas of knowledge, this causes problems. For example, if you choose to become a lawyer solely because it is a prestigious job, because your peers will respect you, or because your parents expect you to, you may be fulfilled in the short term. However, this is a flawed way of choosing a career, as you risk doing something that brings you no happiness or contentment in the long run.
- ### (P2) Overthinking occurs when you chase after conventional ideas of knowledge, which stops you from making decisions and solving problems.
	 -  Moving onto the second premise, suppose you must give a class presentation. If you overthink every small detail, are too worried about messing up your words or your mannerisms, or if you appear professional, it becomes harder to present, and you become paralyzed by conventional knowledge.
- ### P3: Ultimate solutions to problems in life come from acting spontaneously and effortlessly in accordance to nature (with the tao)  
	- Going back to the examples, if you choose to become a lawyer because the practice of law comes naturally to you and learning about it is effortless, you are more likely to be content with your profession in the long run. As for the presentation, instead of overthinking the social conventions around presentations (like mannerisms or professionalism). If you act on what comes naturally and effortlessly, it will be easier to present, and you will not be paralyzed by conventional knowledge.
### C: Therefore, if you abandon overthinking, you will be free from problems.

## Objection To Passivity
- ### While there may be some cases where passivity is better than determined actions. This will not always be the case
	  - A potential objection to this argument is to premise three. Imagine you are in a relationship, and your partner is not doing chores around the house. If what comes naturally to you is to be passive and go with the flow, then your partner will not know to change. However, if you take determined action and tell them how you feel about the situation, they will know to change. So, acting on what comes naturally is not always the best solution to some problems.
  
  ## Response to Objection
	- Sadly, this argument misunderstands what acting on what is natural means. Suppose you are in a rushing river flowing directly to a waterfall. If you take extreme action and swim against the current, you may make gains in the short term, but after a while, you will tire out and fall off the waterfall. If you stay fully passive and choose not to do anything, you will meet the same fate and fall off the waterfall. However, if you instead flow with the current towards the riverbank, you will survive. To act on what is natural does not always mean passivity; you can take determined action, but you only act on what is effortless and comes about naturally, you do not force things to go your way. You instead adapt to the problems that come your way, like a sapling in a storm.
