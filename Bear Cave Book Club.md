#### An online book club that will come together for an hour every 1-2 weeks to discuss a chosen book. 


## Ground Rules! 
1. You gotta be respectful of other people, dont discriminate agaisnt others, etc. Follow the rules of the server we are apart of. 

2. Please take every book we read seriously, as seriously as the author writing it wanted us to. If the book goes against your beliefs, whether moral, political, or religious, do not write it off and refuse to take it seriously. I encourage us to critically think and come to agreements or disagreements with the texts. But to first critique something, you must **Understand it!**

3. Read the Text Closely! We will often take alot of time to go through texts. The assigned reading passages can be as short as 25 pages with 1-2 weeks to read them! (obviously depending on the genre, assigned readings for fiction will be longer than assigned readings of philosophical works which will often be on this shorter end). So with that time, I encourage us all to read the text closely, and reread it. As my Professor has told us time and time again, **good reading is rereading!**

4. We will often be discussing works which are religious or athiestic in nature. With this in mind, you can see how why it is important to be respectful of rule 2. At the same time however, if you find yourself to be apart of whatever group the book discusses in temrs of religion. Do not use the book as an oppourtunity to (for lack of a more universal term) evangelize or proslytize your faith, whatever it may be. This is not to say that that you cannot share your life experiences (which for many is tied to religious faith) during our discussion of these types of works. But there is a clear difference between doing that and evangelism. **Let the books speak for themselves.**

5. The majority of us are not PhD's in philosophy, literature, humanities, political thought, social science, theology/religious studies, or any of the topics discussed. With that in mind, **do not be afraid to say dumb/silly things**, we all dont know much about anything, we are all dumb and silly, and the only way for us to become smarter is to have the courage to speak up and share your thoughts!  

## What types of books will we discuss?
- Anything is allowed to be put forth to be discussed. However, whatever books are requested by participating members will be put to a vote for everyone to decide what we read next.
