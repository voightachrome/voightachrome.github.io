#### An online book club that will come together for an hour every 1-2 weeks to discuss a chosen book. 


## Ground Rules! 
1. You gotta be respectful of other people, don't discriminate against others, etc. Follow the rules of the server we are a part of. 

2. Please take every book we read seriously, as seriously as the author who wrote it wanted us to. If the book goes against your beliefs, whether moral, political, or religious, do not write it off and refuse to take it seriously. We should critically think and come to agreements or disagreements with the texts. But to first critique something, you must **Understand it!**

3. Read the Text Closely! We often take a long time to go through texts. The assigned reading passages can be as short as 25 pages with 1-2 weeks to read them! (Obviously, depending on the genre, assigned fiction readings will be longer than assigned readings of philosophical works, which will often be on this shorter end. With that time, I encourage us all to read the text closely and reread it. As my Professor has told us time and time again, **good reading is rereading!**

4. We will often be discussing works which are religious or atheistic in nature. With this in mind, you can see why it is important to be respectful of Rule 2. At the same time, however, if you find yourself part of whatever group the book discusses in terms of religion. Do not use the book as an opportunity to (for lack of a more universal term) evangelize or proselytize your faith, whatever it may be. This is not to say that you cannot share your life experiences (which, for many, is tied to religious faith) during our discussion of these types of works. But there is a clear difference between doing that and evangelism. **Let the books speak for themselves.**

5. The majority of us are not PhDs in philosophy, literature, humanities, political thought, social science, theology/religious studies, or any of the topics discussed. With that in mind, **do not be afraid to say dumb/silly things**. None of us know much about anything; we are all dumb and silly, and the only way for us to become smarter is to have the courage to speak up and share our thoughts!  

## What types of books will we discuss?
- Anything is allowed to be put forth to be discussed. However, whatever books are requested by participating members will be put to a vote for everyone to decide what we read next.

## Book 1 ! 
**Confessions By St. Augustine:**
-  **NOTE:** Please read from the Oxford World's Classics Version (Translated by Hendry Chadwick), if you have a different version that works as well, but if you can stick to this translation!

## First Meeting + Assigned Reading: Friday Jan 30th! Please read all of Book I
