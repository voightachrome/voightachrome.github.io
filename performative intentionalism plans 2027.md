## Field Notes 

#### this is what i think end game for me is right now 

cold turkey blocker with 2 types of blocks: 

**#1** a semester long block where i can reevaluate my use for those apps another time or just perma block them entirely 
   - the only things i can see falling into the first category is AI. Things that would be perma blocked would be nsfw + twitter (partially because of its mixed sfw/nsfw nature, mostly because its a cesspool of ai slop, disinformation, bot accounts, and ragebaiters on the internet) 

**#2** A schedule to block social media at all times except for 10:00 - 10:30pm (whenever an hour before my desired bedtime is).

instagram/tiktok/discord/facebook either partially blocked or fully blocked within #2 

- discord will be partially blocked so that i can access study vc through the web, important threads that i have written (until i move over to my website to share bodies of work), as well as to DM people and to access irl GC's through beeper for planning w irls

- instagram web will be fully blocked (for now), with access to DM's and GC's through beeper for accessing irls

- tiktok and facebook will be fully blocked within the duration of the schedule 

- I have thought about reddit as well, but i have genuine uses for the platform with the existence of r/askphilosophy and my university subreddit. among other things. setting it to old reddit as well makes it less compelling for me to want to use

any thoughts?
