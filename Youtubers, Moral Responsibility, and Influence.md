# Youtubers, Moral Responsibility, and Influence
This is not meant to be a remarkably serious post. However, I think it is worth addressing for now, as I will definitely come to this later to flesh it out more. 

## Do YouTubers have moral responsibilities due to their outsized influence on other people?

I should first clear out any obvious places where YouTubers have moral responsibilities. It seems that YouTubers have a moral responsibility not to deceive their audience. In other words, it seems that YouTubers have a duty not to treat their audience as a mere means to an end (through deception or coercion), and audience members have the right to be treated with dignity and respect. 

*(This seems to include a moral responsibility to not profit off of the parasocial nature of YouTuber-Fan relationships by selling AI versions of yourself to your fans to interact with.  I would like to develop this thought further eventually, so do not take it too seriously for now)*


Everything up to this point seems to be relatively uncontroversial. What seems to be more controversial is what constitutes a YouTuber acting in good faith regarding their influence. 


I think that YouTubers have a responsibility to ensure that they say informed, thought-out things to their fan base. (Within the context of videos, the bar for livestreams seems to be less high, because of the nature of the medium.) If they choose not to, that is fine, *However they have a responsibility to disclose that to their audience.* A person who chooses to ignore both of these conditions does not seem to be acting in good faith regarding their influence. This does not mean that you are not allowed to change your mind when it comes to an idea or an opinion. However, it does mean that you must make a genuine effort to be informed, to not peddle misinformation, to know when you are not fully informed and to disclose that before sharing your idea or opinion, and to correct yourself when you say things that turn out to be wrong after the fact. 


Furthermore, I think that YouTubers have a responsibility to have clear or consistent messaging when it comes to the goals or aims of their channel. Although I would not consider this to be a strong moral responsibility, the bar for what counts as "clear" should not be very high. A lot of responsibility here would instead be on the audience to interpret the creator charitably, and to take the time to critically think about the message the YouTuber is trying to promote before they themselves critique it. If you do not understand take the time to understand something, you cannot make criticisms against it. 

## Why does this even matter? Why should YouTubers have extra moral responsibilities to act in good faith (aside from the obvious responsibilities previously discussed)?
